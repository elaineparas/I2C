Initial Phase of Development of Sumlang Lake
In the year 2013, the barangay and the local tourism office and stakeholders started promoting the place and attracting more visitors to try the balsa boating activity. Consequently, the LGU and the barangay conducted The Balsa Race, a unique water sports event that draws even more participants from the neighboring barangays, municipalities, cities, and visiting guests. Sumlang Lake became the venue of photography sessions, culinary and cooking demos and photo shoots, product showcase activities during the Pinangat Festival and Sumlang Lake Festival, and location shoots of some film productions.

2021 - 2022
The Eco-Tourism Development and Its Impact on the Quality of Life of the Community
There was a decline in number of tourists visiting the lake due to the effect of the pandemic from 2020 up to this time. However, in December 2021 the Lake re-opened its gates, and tourists started to visit us once more.

2023 - Present
The emergence of businesses in the area flourished as more tourists began to visit, drawn by the breathtaking beauty of Mayon Volcano and the serene lake that lies in its shadow. This influx of visitors created a vibrant local economy, with new establishments sprouting up to cater to the growing demand. Local artisans also saw an opportunity to showcase their crafts, selling handmade goods that reflected the region's rich cultural heritage. As word spread about the stunning views and unique experiences available, the area's reputation as a must-visit destination grew, leading to a steady increase in both domestic and international tourists.
